# Increment Counter Project

This is a simple web project that implements an increment counter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The increment counter project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the counter.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the counter functionality.

## Usage

To use the increment counter, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see multiple counter sections displayed on the webpage.
4. Each counter section consists of an icon, a counter value, and a description.
5. The counter value starts from 0 and increments towards the specified target value.
6. The target value is defined using the `data-target` attribute in the HTML.
7. As the page loads, the counters will animate and increment to their respective target values.
8. Feel free to customize the icons, target values, and descriptions in the HTML file to suit your needs.

## Customization

You can customize the project in the following ways:

- Icons: The icons used for the counters are from the [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) library. You can change the icons by updating the class names of the `<i>` elements in the HTML.
- Target Values: Each counter has a `data-target` attribute in the HTML that specifies the target value. Update these values to your desired targets.
- Styling: The appearance and layout of the counters can be customized by modifying the styles in the `style.css` file.
